-->

I am:
* Currently doing Masters of Engineering at The University of Melbourne, majoring in Mechatronics Systems, more to the coding part. 
* Enthusiast of creating and automate basically anything around. 
* Enjoys a walk up the mountain peaks, and taking some pictures like a typical Asain tourist.
* Always up for some warm coffee in the breeze of Melbourne, or trÃ  Ä‘Ã¡ under the heat of Sai Gon.

I also have a [little personal website](https://tkhoinguyen.netlify.app/) if you'd like to know more about me. Make sure to check out the [photo section](https://tkhoinguyen.netlify.app/photography/) as well ðŸ˜„!

**Cheers!**
